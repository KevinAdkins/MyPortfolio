This is where I can host my "Portfolio" online for free. 
I did have it setup into multiple pages but as I worked on this I realized how its easier for people to read and view from one page with just clicking the sections and automatiaclly going there.
I had to redoploy the site several times and even readd my files, so if you don't see any "previous updated" messages, that is why sorry.
Honestly I am playing around with this website as a way to learn and understand what something does.
There will be more added to this portfolio in the future besides "About" and "Projects"
